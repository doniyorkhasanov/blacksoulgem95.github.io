As a person who has spent years in the startup environment, and in the investment to public and private companies market, I wanted to share with you my perspective of what's happening.

Which, by the way, might be completely wrong - as MacroEconomics is not a fixed science.

2020 - the raw-uncooked-bat flu shaked the world. SARS-Cov-19 was (and still is in a way) a dangerous disease that spread through the globe in a record breaking way. Companies had to figure out a way to be productive without having workers into buildings. The buildings they bought as an investment.

People started to work remotely, from home, no one went out if not for basic necessities, and the market of social networks and communications went high: a bubble started.

With the need of socialising digitally and connect with people through digital ways, companies in the communications market (yes, this includes us) had a spike in user/customer base and market value.

Investors started to put money in any company that promised help into remote working and remote socialising.

If you are from my generation, you might recall a videogame: Habbo Hotel, then the spiritual successor of it: Second Life.

Second Life, that came out exactly 19 years ago, in 2003 (and now I feel old), is a game where you would create your digital 3D avatar, have your own digital room/house to decorate with things you buy in the " digital marketplace", digital clothes, accessories and many more to buy in the same marketplace for your avatar. Then, you would play with all your friends, online. You can chat, they can come to your digital house, you can go to a digital pub... etc.

Meta, in 2021, announced the "Metaverse", essentially the same thing Second Life is, but with a VR headset, with the graphic detail level of the same game from 2003. $15 BILLION dollars spent on this. And people were investing, thinking that Covid would never end, or that people would still prefer to socialise through a computer rather than in person.

Everyone was hyped about this new way of connecting to people, until this year: Covid started to fade away, people are again travelling, meeting in person and going to offices. Companies, who before Covid invested in massive HQs, are now demanding their workforce to come back to the office (looking at you, JPM&C).

People gradually lost interest in socialising through a computer and came back to meet in pubs, restaurants and social spaces telling us one truth: humans need the physical human warmth - socialising digitally can't replace that.

Interest in the metaverse? Gone, same all the investments. Social networks, Streaming Media Companies, Communcations Companies, who had a spike in usebase, are now losing users. The "Fully Remote" bubble has bursted.

## What companies are going bad?

the User 2 User focused companies, like Meta (FB, IG, WA), Google, Twitter, Snapchat, etc, where you, as the user, are the product to their customers, which are the companies running advertisments. Less users? Less ad revenue.

## What companies are caught in the downfall even if they're actually doing okay?

Business 2 Customer companies, like Kaleyra, Twilio, etc, are caught in the wave of panic towards the communications industry, even tho we are doing okay financially. Banks still needs to contact remotely their users. Food Delivery still needs to send SMSs. OTPs are a hardcore standard in multi-factor authentication security.

This is also exactly why Elon's doing what he's doin to Twitter: transform the (free) user into a paying customer, through subscription services - in order to recover it's ad-revenue loss and move towards a more sustainable way of financing the company.

We definetly learnt through this bubble that ad-revenue based companies are not sustainable, and heavily susceptible to almost anything in the real world.

## What I see (most probably just wish) will take over the web in the next future
I saw the Internet being born, when older (than me) people thought it was just a nerd thingy will disapper soon ( the dot com bubble ) - but now every industry is dependant on this technology.

Internet was originally born as a place of freedom, where everyone can have their spaces and communicate with other people, with a sort of federated systems, such as e-mails.

With Google, Virgilio and Tiscali in Italy, AOL and Yahoo in the US, Amazon globally and many more, Internet became service-centered.

Now, people instead are moving towards places like Mastodon, a federated social network using the ActivityPub standard to interact with other instances. You chose where your data is and who manages it (you can actually DIY if you have the time and resources) and interact with any user from any place. (PS. if you're interested in joining Mastodon, hit me up, I run an instance)

I envision a future where privacy starts to become more valued, and where people will slowly switch to what Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of World Wide Web in 1989, envisioned his creation would've been: a [federated system of knowledge and information sharing](https://solidproject.org/).

We will have a bright future ahead, and many swift in paradigms. Many companies will move back to office-first work (Capitalism... they invested in the buildings and needs to bring that into fruition), while many more will discover the beauty of remote-first work (Zapier has amazing guides on that). We will be more aware of our use of data, how we share information and privacy.

What do you think? What are your opinions?
